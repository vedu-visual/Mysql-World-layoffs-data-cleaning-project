👤 Author: Vedant Ratnakar

🎯 Objective: Transform raw global layoffs data into a clean, analysis-ready dataset and deliver executive-level insights through SQL and Tableau dashboards.

🚀 Project Overview

This end-to-end analytics project focuses on cleaning, structuring, analyzing, and visualizing global company layoff data using MySQL and Tableau.

The project simulates a real-world analytics workflow, starting from messy raw data to decision-ready dashboards used for identifying trends, risks, and patterns across industries, geographies, and time periods.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation (MySQL)

The dataset was cleaned and standardized using advanced SQL techniques to ensure accuracy and usability for analysis.

Key Data Cleaning Steps

3	Standardized text fields (company, industry, country)
4	Converted date fields into SQL DATE format
5	Handled missing values using relational matching logic
6	Removed records with insufficient or unusable data

📌 Outcome: A clean, reliable dataset suitable for analytics and visualization.
